<p><strong>Google</strong> has not had any of its 85,000+ employees successfully <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/phishing'>phished</a> on their work-related accounts since early 2017, when it began requiring all employees to use physical Security Keys in place of passwords and one-time codes, the company told KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<div><p class="wp-caption-text">A YubiKey Security Key made by Yubico. The basic model featured here retails for $20.</p></div>
<p>Security Keys are inexpensive <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/USB'>USB</a>-based devices that offer an alternative approach to two-factor authentication (<a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/two-factor authentication'>2FA</a>), which requires the user to log in to a Web site using something they know (the password) and something they have (e.g., a mobile device).</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said Security Keys now form the basis of all account access at Google.</p>
<p>“We have had no reported or confirmed account takeovers since implementing security keys at Google,” the spokesperson said. “Users might be asked to authenticate using their security key for many different apps/reasons. It all depends on the sensitivity of the app and the risk of the user at that point in time.”</p>
<p>The basic idea behind two-factor authentication is that even if thieves manage to <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/phishing'>phish</a> or steal your password, they still cannot log in to your account unless they also <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/hacker'>hack</a> or possess that second factor.</p>
<p>The most common forms of <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/two-factor authentication'>2FA</a> require the user to supplement a password with a one-time code sent to their mobile device via text message or an app. Indeed, prior to 2017 Google employees also relied on one-time codes generated by a mobile app — <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Google Authenticator'>Google Authenticator</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, a Security Key implements a form of <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Multi-factor authentication'>multi-factor authentication</a> known as <strong>Universal 2nd Factor (<a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a>)</strong>, which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/USB'>USB</a> device and pressing a button on the device. The key works without the need for any special software drivers.</p>
<p>Once a device is enrolled for a specific Web site that supports Security Keys, the user no longer needs to enter their password at that site (unless they try to access the same account from a different device, in which case it will ask the user to insert their key).</p>
<p><a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a> is an emerging open source authentication standard, and as such only a handful of high-profile sites currently support it, including Dropbox, Facebook, Github (and of course Google’s various services). Most major password managers also now support <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a>, including <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Dashlane'>Dashlane</a>, and <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/KeePass'>Keepass</a>, <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Duo Security'>Duo Security</a> also can be set up to work with <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a>.</p>
<p>With any luck, more sites soon will begin incorporating the Web Authentication API— also known as “<a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/WebAuthn'>WebAuthn</a>” — a standard put forth by the <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/World Wide Web Consortium'>World Wide Web Consortium</a> in collaboration with the <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/FIDO Alliance'>FIDO Alliance</a>. The beauty of <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/WebAuthn'>WebAuthn</a> is that it eliminates the need for users to constantly type in their passwords, which negates the threat from common password-stealing methods like <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/phishing'>phishing</a> and <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Man-in-the-middle attack'>man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.</span></p>
<p>Currently, <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a> is supported by Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and <strong>Opera</strong>. In both Firefox and <strong>Quantum</strong> (the newer, faster version of Firefox), <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a> is not enabled by default. To turn it on, type “about:config” in the browser bar, type or paste “security.webauth.<a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a>” and double-click the resulting entry to change the preference’s value from “false” to “true.”</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> says it expects to roll out updates to its flagship <strong>Edge</strong> browser to support <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a> later this year. According to a recent article at 9to5Mac.com, <strong>Apple</strong> has not yet said when or if it will support the standard in its <strong>Safari</strong> browser.</p>
<p>Probably the most popular maker of Security Keys is Yubico, which sells a basic <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a> key for $20 (it offers regular <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/USB'>USB</a> versions as well as those made for devices that require <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/USB'>USB</a>-C connections, such as Apple’s newer <strong>Mac OS</strong> systems). Yubikey also sells more expensive <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Universal 2nd Factor'>U2F</a> keys designed to work with mobile devices.</p>
<p>If a site you frequent does not yet support <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/WebAuthn'>WebAuthn</a>, please consider hardening your login with another form of <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/two-factor authentication'>2FA</a>. Hundreds of sites now support <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Multi-factor authentication'>multi-factor authentication</a>. Twofactorauth.org maintains probably the most comprehensive list of which sites support <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/two-factor authentication'>2FA</a>, indexing each by type of site (email, gaming, finance, etc) and the type of <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/two-factor authentication'>2FA</a> offered (SMS, phone call, software token, etc.).</p>
<p>In general, using SMS and automated phone calls to receive a one-time token is less secure than relying on a software token app like <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Google Authenticator'>Google Authenticator</a> or Authy. That’s because thieves can intercept that one-time code by tricking your mobile provider into either swapping your mobile device’s SIM card or “porting” your mobile number to a different device. However, <em>if the only <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/two-factor authentication'>2FA</a> options offered by a site you frequent are SMS and/or phone calls, it is still better than simply relying on a password.</em></p>
<p>While we’re on the subject of <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Multi-factor authentication'>multi-factor authentication</a>, I should note that Google now offers an extra set of security measures for all of its properties called <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Advanced Protection Program'>Advanced Protection</a>. Exactly how Google’s <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Advanced Protection Program'>Advanced Protection</a> works (and the trade-offs involved in turning it on) will likely be the subject of another story here, but <strong>Wired.com</strong> recently published a decent rundown about it. Incidentally, this article includes a step-by-step guide on how to incorporate Security Keys into <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Advanced Protection Program'>Advanced Protection</a>.</p>
<p>I have been using <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Advanced Protection Program'>Advanced Protection</a> for several months now without any major issues, although it did take me a few tries to get it set up correctly. One frustrating aspect of having it turned on is that it does not allow one to use third-party email applications like <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Mozilla Thunderbird'>Mozilla’s Thunderbird</a> or Outlook. I found this frustrating because as far as I can tell there is no integrated solution in Gmail for <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/PGP'>PGP</a>/<a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/OpenGPG'>OpenGPG</a> email message encryption, and some readers prefer to share news tips this way. Previously, I had used Thunderbird along with a plugin called <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/Enigmail'>Enigmail</a> to do that.</p>
