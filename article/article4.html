This step may help to fix the security bugs that can be identified in earlier versions.</li>
<li><strong>Disabling unnecessary sensors</strong>. Wearable devices have a number of sensors that can track the motion of their users, such as walking, running, or keystrokes while typing on a keyboard. Associate Professor Romit Roy Choudhury from University of Illinois claims that this “sensor data from wearable devices will clearly be a double-edged sword. While the device’s contact to the human body will offer invaluable insights into human health and context, it will also make way for deeper violation into human privacy.” For example, an app that is designed to disguise as a pedometer can gather user’s confidential data, including email information, search queries, and other activity patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid performing important operations on a <a class='wikiPreview' href='#' data-wiki-lang='en' data-wiki-title='json_evaluation/smartwatch'>smartwatch</a></strong>.
